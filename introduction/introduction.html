<p>Arlington's Master Plan, Your Town, Your Future, sets forth a planning and development vision for the town, as well as implementation steps and goals resulting from that vision. The Master Plan was adopted by the Arlington Redevelopment Board on February 4, 2015 and was endorsed by Town Meeting on May 11, 2015.<br>
<a href="https://arlingtonma.gov/departments/planning-community-development/master-plan/master-plan-maps" target="_blank">The Web site includes a downloadable version of the Master Plan in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)</a>. &nbsp;An abbreviated version of the plan containing the goals, key findings, recommendations, and data can be viewed on this website.<br>
The implementation progress of Your Town, Your Future can be followed by viewing the chart located on the <a href="https://arlingtonma.gov/departments/planning-community-development/master-plan/implementation">Implementation page</a>.<br>
Please note that the contents of this Web site are an administrative compilation and not a legal document.</p>
<p>The Arlington Master Plan is the result of a cooperative planning process initiated by the Arlington Department of Planning and Community Development  in October 2012. &nbsp;This plan would not have been possible without the help of the <a href="?navid=373">Master Plan Advisory Committee</a>, the <a href="?navid=184">Arlington Redevelopment Board</a>, the staff of the Department of Planning and Community Development, the <a href="?navid=166">Board of Selectmen</a> and <a href="?navid=134">Arlington's Town Manager</a>. &nbsp;The planning department would like to thank all who participated for their support and their thoughtful and dedicated work over two years that attests to the sense of stewardship that Arlington residents have for their community and the appreciation they have for the place they call home. The Master Plan presents a planning and development vision for the town, as well as measures for implementing the goals and objectives resulting from that vision.</p><br>
<p><strong>Public Participation&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Arlington is fortunate to have a well-established tradition of citizen involvement in major decisions about the life of the town. In Arlington, residents actively participate in the political process and serve as good stewards of open, accessible government. This Master Plan has benefited immeasurably from their deliberations and guidance. From the volunteers who served on the Master Plan Advisory Committee (MPAC) to the people who attended community meetings, responded to surveys, agreed to be interviewed, read and commented on draft documents and maps, and provided valuable information to the consulting team, the Arlington Master Plan has evolved as an effort led and shaped by hundreds of residents who clearly care about their town. &nbsp;A full list of all <a href="?navid=2565">public outreach events can be found here.</a></p>

<div id="pop"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a master plan and why does Arlington need one?</span></div>
<div id="pane">A master plan is a town’s policy statement on physical development. It is a living document that conveys what is planned for the future and helps make change more predictable and desirable, which is attractive to new business and investment. A master plan identifies which areas are appropriate for specific types of residences, commerce, or industry, and which areas are for preservation and conservation, or how a mixture of uses might occur on the same property.<br>
<br>
Arlington is a thriving, attractive, desirable, healthy place to live and do business, but it faces challenges, such as the high cost of housing, a small commercial tax base, and the need to rebuild the high school to keep state accreditation. The Town’s fixed costs have been rising faster every year than its revenue, leading to calls for property tax overrides. In response, the Town has developed a Five Year Fiscal Plan that has improved town finances and the budget process. Arlington housing is in high demand so high-cost units are built in unexpected locations, smaller, affordable houses are being enlarged, and two-family houses are converted into expensive condos. <br>
<br>
The amount of land available for commercial uses, and thus the commercial tax base, has been declining since 1990, putting nearly all the tax burden on residential taxpayers. Arlington residents often have to leave town to afford a home, start a business, get to their jobs, and shop. In recent times, the town did not anticipate or plan in advance for the possible closing of Symmes Hospital and the Brigham’s headquarters. Arlington had to react to private real estate decisions that will now exist for decades, precluding opportunities to consider other land uses on those sites.</div>
<div id="pop2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What was the master plan process?</span></div>
<div id="pane2">To start to address these and other challenges, Arlington began this master plan process in the autumn of 2012 with a community conversation at Town Hall. A Master Plan Advisory Committee of local residents, including Town Meeting members and professionals in relevant fields, was formed. Since then, hundreds of residents have participated in over 75 public workshops, presentations, meetings, interviews, and surveys. They have provided valuable community input for the plan’s vision statement, findings, and recommendations.<br>
<br>
By state law, a planning board formally adopts a master plan. In Arlington, the Redevelopment Board (ARB) has planning board authority. The ARB adopted the Arlington Master Plan as Town policy on February 4, 2015, following a public hearing on January 12. Any changes to zoning or new infrastructure projects, and many other specific recommendations in the Arlington Master Plan would have to be presented to and passed by Town Meeting at some time in the future. For this reason, the ARB and the Master Plan Advisory Committee request Town Meeting’s consideration to accept, receive, or resolve to endorse this Master Plan.</div>
