<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the year 2000 the town has slowly gained 450 new
residents, and projections show this trend will
continue until 2035, when Arlington will have nearly 50,000 residents.<sup>1</sup> This population growth has been
accompanied by age shifts, with increases
in school-aged children and older adults, but losses
in the 20-34 age group. As more young families have
moved into town and non-
family households have
moved out, household size has grown slightly after
decades of decline. Incomes of town residents have
also increased in recent decades. These demographic
changes have important fiscal implications, since
<a href="https://arlingtonma.gov/Home/ShowImage?id=4186" target="_self">school-aged children</a> and senior citizens with fixed
incomes generally present greater costs to Arlington
than working-aged adults, even though income growth
may provide more resources to pay property taxes
that fund town operations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The demographics dashboard below highlights some demographic trends in Arlington over the last few decades. &nbsp;These trends show that Arlington's population is increasing, though will still be far below its peak in 1970, and that most of this increase will occur in the 30-45 year and 65+ year age ranges.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; These graphics are interactive and can be manipulated by either a mouse-click or by hovering over a certain data point. &nbsp;For more information on who lives in Arlington and Arlington's households and families, please navigate to the next page.</p>
